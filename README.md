# Google Replica

## Overview

This website consists of three main pages:

1. **Regular Google Search (index.html):** Type in a query, click "Google Search", and be directed to the Google search results page for that query.

2. **Google Image Search:** Type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results page for that query.

3. **Google Advanced Search:** User can provide input similar to Google's own advanced search options. Clicking the "Advanced Search" button takes the user to the search results page for their query.

The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, when clicked, takes users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
